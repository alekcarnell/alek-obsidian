# Notes

Alan walks us through the thought experiment of having unlimited power. You can either imagine you are a god, or more simply, you just have the ability to dream whatever you dream you would like when you went to sleep every night. 

At first, we would do what everyone expects that we would do. You and I would use that power to get everything we wanted. But that would only go on for so long. And then we, as we understand ourselves now, would get bored. For if we never got bored, we would never change. But we do get bored. And regardless of what we have, we seem willing to mess it all up after awhile just so something interesting will happen. 

Alan Watts does a great job here putting us in the driver seat of our own utopias and then helps us realize that, even in our own world controlled and maintained only for ourselves, we would still add components of suffering just to make it interesting. And we are fooling ourselves if we think we wouldn't. 

Moreover, the sensation we get when we go from a state of suffering to a state of peace is more pleasurable than the peace itself. The relief from waking up from a nightmare, or hearing good news that wards off a catastrophic future outcome that you imagined. 

The Buddhists practice this feeling by purposefully tensing their muscles in their whole body as tight as they can, for as long as they can, and then letting go. 

It seems to all be connected conceptually. We can't help but suffer. We desire it even. And we can't help but desire more than what we already have. The antidote is a daily practice of gratitude.
