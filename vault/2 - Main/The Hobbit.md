# Notes

I liked the chapters on Mirkwood. The transformation of Bilbo from a clumsy hobbit into a brave warrior really takes off there. 

The important lesson that I get from the Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings is that, even in a great magical world, a little hobbit can make a big difference. And they do it without any supernatural powers or special training. It makes me think about all the things I could do in this life with a little courage and some faith.
