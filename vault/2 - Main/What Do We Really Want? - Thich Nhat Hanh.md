I think this is true and I also think there is a middle-way in working as hard as you can while taking care of yourself and your life. Sometimes I think about all of the things that I "like" to do in order to relax, but really I value those things based on how useful I think they are to me; What kind of edge I will gain from doing them. Which is probably why I can't relax very often. Video games feel like the only thing that I do that I do for their own sake. But I still do them in hopes of mastering them to some degree. My efforts of being number one have cost me relaxation, healing, and happiness. Sometimes it has been worth it, sometimes it has not been. I should try to find better balance in pursuing greatness and being present.
