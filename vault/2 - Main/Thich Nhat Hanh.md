# Notes

## Impression:
At some point in my life, around 2019, I became deeply interested in Buddhism. Having already been exposed to it by [[Alan Watts]], I started looking for meditation videos. My therapist at the time also suggested I look into some guided meditation videos to help with my anxiety. And so I did. Most of them were alright and helpful. But eventually I came across one from Thich Nhat Hanh that I fell in love with. This mans voice wasn't just talking about being at peace, I could tell he was truly and deeply at peace. The feeling was contagious whenever he spoke. 

After digging deeper I would find out the incredible history about this man. But what makes him so special was not necessarily his legendary beginnings or his intellect. Rather, his commitment to simplicity and practice. He never tried to blow our minds or jostle our thoughts so that we could see truth or enlightenment. He only ever asked us to sit down and breathe. And the thing is, when I listened, my mind *was* blown. But he never preached about what amazing things you would see or feel, or what other dimensions or consciousness expanding experiences you might have. He only ever said that if you want to feel joy, and you want to minimize your suffering, sit down... and breathe.
