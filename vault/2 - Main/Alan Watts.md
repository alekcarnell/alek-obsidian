# Notes

Alan played a great role in helping export Eastern philosophy and religion to the West (Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism) and, assessed that the West was being overcome by anxiety and worry and that eastern philosophy had a medical property to it that could help. His antidote was prescribing the psychoanalysis of eastern religion via his "spiritual entertainment" as he put it, and it was my gateway drug into deeper introspective thinking, spiritual thought experimentation, and feeling at one with my own existence. Endless hours were spent actively listening, or falling asleep to, his lectures which have been preserved on YouTube and in some audio-books.
